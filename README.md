# Tripto
Tripto is designed to revolutionize the tourist experience by offering three main key services. Firstly, personalized trips through a recommender engine that matches specific interests and user actions. Secondly, a highly trained virtual guide providing real-time information and nearby activities. Lastly, a chatbot for quick assistance and recommendations.

Imagine this: You're exploring a new place, and Tripto's virtual guide comes to life, providing you with instant, real-time information speech about the places you visit. As you stand in front of a historic monument, the virtual guide enlightens you with fascinating facts, and historical context, creating an immersive and enriching experience.

The virtual guide also helps you navigate the city with ease. No more struggling with maps or guidebooks. Tripto's GPS connectivity ensures that you receive real-time directions and updates, making sure you never miss out on any hidden gems or must-see attractions nearby.

Our recommender Engine is a sophisticated system that enhances the personalized recommendations of places and tour packages for users. It comprises two key components, Collaborative Filtering and User-Based recommendation.

But that's not all! Tripto's chatbot feature acts as your knowledgeable travel companion, available to assist you at any moment.

We've worked on Android Kotlin for the frontend. In the backend, we use FastAPI to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and the server, while PostgreSQL served as the backbone of our database, storing all the places information and user preferences and actions.
